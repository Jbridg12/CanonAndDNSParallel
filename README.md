I just wanted to include a file detailing my submission for this project.
The code is functional for each algorthm and it will run for all thr required 
amount of processors.

HOWEVER, I was not able to get DNS with 512 procs to run by the submission deadline of this project.
The wait time in the queue was about a day for each run and I did not queue it properly the night prior.
You may notice the charts with DNS have only three elements, this is why. Additioanlly, I could not
completely understand what the chart specification was supposed to be for the comparison graphs. The
amount of processors are not the same and 512 and 8 does not have a clean square root and would not 
run with canon's algorthms in this implementation.

As a result, I appreviated the processors to timestamps, 1 = the first amount of processors (for both this is 1),
2 = the second amount (8 or 16), 3 = (64 for both algorithms), and 4 = (256 or 512). I though about comparing the
ones with the same small p e.g. 1 and 1, 16 and 64, and 64 and 512. However, that was only three and thus I imagined
not right.

Thank you for understanding.
